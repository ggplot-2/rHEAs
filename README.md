# rHEAs





# Aims

**Boost the design process of high-entropy alloys with machine learning .**

1. Convert unstructured data of high-entropy alloys from journal papers  to structured database or knowledge base  with machine reading system (```DeepDive```) or volunteer community of materials background.(**On going**)
2. Data visualization of the structured database exploring the distribution of alloys performance and the relationship of different variables.
3. Data Mining & Machine Learning:  select proper input features and train a learning model, especially random forest and neural network.(**On going **)
