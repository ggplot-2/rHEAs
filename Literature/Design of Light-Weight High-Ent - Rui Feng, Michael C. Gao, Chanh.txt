Abstract: High-entropy alloys (HEAs) are a new class of solid-solution alloys that have attracted

worldwide attention for their outstanding properties. Owing to the demand from transportation

and defense industries, light-weight HEAs have also garnered widespread interest from scientists

for use as potential structural materials. Great efforts have been made to study the phase-formation

rules of HEAs to accelerate and refine the discovery process. In this paper, many proposed

solid-solution phase-formation rules are assessed, based on a series of known and newly-designed

light-weight HEAs. The results indicate that these empirical rules work for most compositions but

also fail for several alloys. Light-weight HEAs often involve the additions of Al and/or Ti in great

amounts, resulting in large negative enthalpies for forming solid-solution phases and/or intermetallic

compounds. Accordingly, these empirical rules need to be modified with the new experimental data.

In contrast, CALPHAD (acronym of the calculation of phase diagrams) method is demonstrated

to be an effective approach to predict the phase formation in HEAs as a function of composition

and temperature. Future perspectives on the design of light-weight HEAs are discussed in light of

CALPHAD modeling and physical metallurgy principles.

1. Introduction

Recently, high-entropy alloys (HEAs) have gained much attention for their ability to expand

the limited range of traditional alloys systems and because of their outstanding mechanical

properties [1–6]. Due to the demand from transportation and defense industries, the development of a new generation of light-weight alloys has also brought widespread interest in HEAs to the

materials science and engineering communities, expressly, for the purpose of saving energy and

raw materials [7–15]. The trial-and-error approach that has been used for traditional alloys design is costly and time-consuming for the discovery of new HEAs because of the vast compositional

space that they occupy. As a consequence, efforts have been made to study HEA phase-formation

rules to accelerate the discovery process [4, 16–29]. Taking advantage of the phase-formation rules, the constitutive phases in HEAs can be controlled and adjusted to improve mechanical properties.

In recently-developed light-weight HEAs (the densities of light-weight HEAs are defined as less than

7.00 g·cm−3 in this paper, considering that most HEAs studied in the literature have densities more

than 7.00 g·cm−3), most of them are composed of solid solutions (SS) and intermetallics (IM), with only

a few compositions forming single-phase solid solutions [7,9,11,13,15]. A majority of the light-weight HEAs contain Al and/or Ti in high concentrations in order to lower the density. However, Al (and Ti)

tends to form very stable intermetallic compounds with (late) transition-metal elements (TMs) due to

the apparent differences in atomic radii and electronegativity. Although Li- and Mg-containing HEAs

are reported [30–32], their microstructures show a mixture of various intermetallic compounds.

In order to explore advanced light-weight HEAs, it is essential to adjust the alloy composition, and,

thus, the resulting constitutive phases in the microstructure in order to achieve the desired physical

and mechanical properties, while keeping the density as low as possible. Therefore, it is important

to investigate these empirical phase-formation rules, as applied to light-weight HEAs. Meanwhile,

CALPHAD (the acronym of the calculation of phase diagrams) method is also used here to compare

the effectiveness of predicting the single-phase solid solutions versus the empirical parameters.

In this regard, many developed formation rules have been summarized and discussed in this

paper. The corresponding parameters are also calculated, using these rules, by applying them to

a series of developed HEAs and our newly-designed light-weight HEAs, aiming to provide more

available experimental data for the assessment of the phase-formation rules in this study. Moreover,

the CALPHAD modeling is performed for several equimolar light-weight HEAs. Combined with the

experimental results, the phase-prediction effectiveness of the phase-formation rules and CALPHAD

method for light-weight HEAs are studied as a way to accelerate the design of new light-weight HEAs

with targeted properties.

2. Materials and Methods

Our newly-designed light-weight HEAs comprise of five elements: Al, Cr, Fe, Mn and Ti.

To examine the compositional effect on density and phase formation, the Al molar ratio is allowed to

vary from 1 to 4. To minimize the formation of detrimental intermetallic compounds, the Ti molar ratio

is kept at 1 or 0.25. Strictly speaking, Al2CrFeMnTi0.25, Al3CrFeMnTi0.25, and Al4CrFeMnTi0.25 alloys

do not meet the HEA definition (HEAs consist of 5 or more elements between 5 and 35 atomic percent

(at.%).) proposed by Yeh et al. [2]. They were designed to explore the lower-density compositional space. In consideration of the possible high-temperature applications, these newly-developed alloys

contain Al and Cr in large amounts. The addition of Al (or Cr) holds the potential to form a protective

dense surface scale of Al2O3 (or Cr2O3).

The AlxCrFeMnTiy alloys (where the x and y values are in molar ratios: x = 1, 1.5, 2, 3, and 4;

and y = 0.25 and 1, respectively) were prepared by arc-melting the constituent elements (element

purity > 99.9 weight percentage). To achieve a homogeneous distribution of elements in the alloy, the

melting and solidification processes were repeated five times.

The chemical composition and estimated density, ρ, of the alloys are listed in Table 1. Note that the densities of these alloys were estimated, using a rule of mixtures assumption, based on a disordered

solid solution, as given by:

∑ ciAi

ρ =

(1)

∑ ciAi

ρ i

where ci, Ai, and ρ i are the atomic percentage, atomic weight, and density of the ith constituent element.

The alloys studied here are in the as-cast state. The crystal structures were identified on the

well-polished bulk samples by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Bruker, Billerica, MA, USA), using a Bruker

diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation. The microstructures were characterized, by scanning-electron

microscopy (SEM, Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany), using a LEO Gemini 1525 field-emission

scanning-electron microscope equipped with the backscattering-electron (BSE, K. E. Developments Ltd.,

Cambridge, UK) detector and the energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDX, Oxford Instruments,

Abingdon, UK).

3. Phase-Formation Rules of HEAs

In order to predict the formation of solid solutions in HEAs, many phenomenological parameters

based on thermodynamics and physics have been proposed [3,4,6, 16,17,19,33]. In this study, several classic models were selected, and their main features are summarized as follows:

Based on thermodynamics and Hume-Rothery rules, Zhang et al. [3,4, 16] put forward three parameters to suggest a criterion for the formation of a solid solution: the atomic-radius

difference ( δ r), enthalpy of mixing (∆Hmix), and entropy of mixing (∆Smix). They are defined by

Equations (2)–(4), respectively:

q

δ r =

∑n c

i=1 i (1 − ri /r)2

(2)

n

where r = ∑ ciri, ci and ri are the atomic percentage and radius of the ith element, respectively; and

i=1

n

∆Hmix = ∑ Ωijcicj

(3)

i=1,i6=j

where Ωij = 4∆Hmix, ∆Hmix is the enthalpy of mixing between the ith and jth elements at the

ij

ij

equi-molar composition in the liquid using the Miedema model; and

n

∆Smix = −R∑ (cilnci)

(4)

i=1

where R is the gas constant. Note that the configurational entropy of an alloy usually decreases, as

the temperature decreases since lowering the temperature promotes developing atomic ordering

or separation for the alloy.

As a result, the true Sconf is temperature dependent, and its

temperature dependence can be calculated from hybrid Monte Carlo/molecular dynamics (MC/MD)

simulations [34]. Other entropy contributions to solid solutions or intermetallics phases may include the phonon vibration, magnetism, and electron excitation, which can be calculated from first-principles

density functional theory (DFT) modeling [35,36].

To further present the balance between the entropy of mixing and the enthalpy of mixing, another

parameter, Ω, was also proposed [16,29], as expressed below:

Ω

T

=

m∆Smix

(5)

|∆Hmix|

n

where Tm = ∑ ci(Tm)i, (Tm)i stands for the melting point of the ith element.

i=1

Based on the existing data for HEAs, the empirical criteria for forming disordered solid solutions

in as-cast HEAs were suggested to be −15 < ∆Hmix < 5kJ · mol−1 and 0% < δ r < 5%, or Ω ≥ 1.1 and δ r < 6.6%.

Recently, for the design of single-phase HEAs, Ye et al. [19] proposed a single thermodynamic parameter, φ, taking into account the enthalpy of mixing and the excess entropy of mixing, which results from the dense atomic packing and atomic-size misfit. The single-parameter, φ, can be expressed as: SC − SH

φ =

|∆

where S

C = ∆Smix, and SH =

T

E denotes the excess entropy of mixing, which is a function of

m

the atomic packing and atomic size. As reported, a HEA tends to form a single-phase solid solution

when φ ≥ φ c ( φ c is the critical value of φ that separates the single-phase solid solution from the multi-phase structures). Otherwise, a multi-phase structure develops when φ ≤ φ c. Moreover, the φ c is identified to be around 20 according to the investigation of Ye et al. [19].

In fact, the formation of the solid-solution phase or intermetallic phase depends on the competition

of the Gibbs free energies between solid solutions and intermetallics. In this regard, King et al. [20]

proposed a new parameter, Φ, to describe the competition of the Gibbs free energies between these

two phases:





∆Hss

(7)



∆HMid





f



where ∆Hss − T∆S

mix

mix is the change in the Gibbs free energy for the formation of a fully-disordered

solid solution, resulting from a mixture of its individual elements. ∆HMid is the enthalpy of formation

f

of a most stable “hypothetical” intermetallic compound among all the constituent binaries from

the constituents of the mixture, while ignoring their entropy since the configurational entropy of

intermetallic compounds is usually low or zero [20] and other entropy sources may cancel out between compounds and solid-solution phases [20].

The details to calculate the ∆Hss and ∆HMid values using the Miedema’s model are described

mix

f

in Reference [20], following the approach published in Reference [37]. It should be noted that in general, the calculated ∆Hss and ∆HMid values, using the Miedema model, have relatively large

mix

f

errors. Therefore, King et al. claimed that when Φ is larger than 1, solid-solution phase will form at

the system’s melting temperature. The Φ parameters for all the compositions listed in Table 2 were calculated according to Equation (7) via the single phase high-entropy alloys (SPHEAs) program [38].

Another similar criterion based on enthalpy considerations was proposed by Troparevsky et al. [18].

They used the enthalpy of formation of binary compounds that are predicted, using DFT calculations in

the literature. Based on the calculated enthalpy matrix, it was claimed that a single-phase solid solution would form if the enthalpies of formation of all possible binary compounds fall within a specified range.

This range requires binary compounds to be neither too stable, leading to the precipitation of that

compound, nor unstable, indicating the immiscibility of the constituent elements. Using the enthalpy

of the formation matrix provided in Reference [18], a parameter, Φ f (similar to Φ), is calculated, which is expressed as follows.

Φ

Tann∆Smix

f =

(8)





∆HDFT



f



here, Tann is the annealing temperature used to achieve the corresponding equilibrium state in

the experiments, and an appropriate value is suggested to be Tann = 0.55Tm in the work of

Troparevsky et al. [18]. Values in the enthalpy of formation matrix in Reference [18] were used for ∆Hf to calculate Φ f . This model ignores the enthalpy of solid-solution phases and the entropy of

intermetallic compounds.

Utilizing these developed phase-formation rules mentioned above, the entirety of the

corresponding empirical parameters was calculated, based on existing and newly-designed

light-weight HEAs (density < 7.00 g·cm−3). In addition, several classic HEAs are selected to

compare with the light-weight HEAs. These parameters are listed in Table 2. For a comprehensive list of single-phase HEAs in face-centered cubic (FCC) [1,3,6], body-centered cubic (BCC) [3,6, 39], or hexagonal close-packed (HCP) [3,6,7, 40–42] structures that are experimentally verified or computationally predicted, the reader is referred to a recent publication [26]. It should be noted that the listed alloys in Table 2 were in the as-cast state, except for Al20Li20Mg10Sc20Ti30 and AlFeMgTiZn, which were produced by mechanical alloying.

Although the region of solid solutions and region of solid solutions + intermetallics cannot be

distinguished, using Φ or Φ f values (≥1) alone, the combination of Φ or Φ f with the atomic-radius

difference, δ r appears to be more effective criteria than with ∆Hmix, or Ω, as demonstrated in Figures 5

and 6. In other words, when Φ or Φ f is less than 1, single-phase solid solutions may still form if the atomic-radius difference is sufficiently small (In this study, δ r should be less than the 4.7%).

On the other hand, even if δ r is larger than 4.7%, large Φ or Φ f parameters may still promote forming single-phase solid solution, as in the NbTiVZr alloy (Table 2). In fact, the formation of single-phase solid solutions is the result of the synergy of the thermodynamic factors, atomic-size effects, and other factors. Therefore, thermodynamic factors and atomic-size effects must be considered together when

predicting the phase formation of light-weight HEAs.

Furthermore, in order to find more meaningful phase-formation criteria by combing different rules,

Φf versus φ, and Φf versus Φ are plotted in Figure 7. In Figure 7a, the yellow area represents the region forming single-phase solid solutions, while the blue region stands for the area forming single-phase

solid solutions plus intermetallic phases, and they are separated by the φ c = 7. In Figure 7b, the selected alloys are divided to four regions by the dash lines Φ f = 1 and Φ = 1. In examining the two plots,

it is obvious that the combinations of the thermodynamic parameters can only correctly predict the

formation of single-phase solid solutions in classic HEAs, while failing to predict the formation of

single-phase solid solutions in light-weight HEAs.

solidification for plots (d–f) are generated using the Scheil model [52].

For AlNbTiV at equilibrium (Figure 8a), the database correctly predicts the formation of the

BCC phase over an extremely wide temperature range. The primary BCC phase starts to form at T =

1752 °C; the solidus temperature (Tsol) is 1717 °C. At the decomposition temperature (Tdec) of 679 °C,

the primary BCC phase decomposes to a Ti-poor BCC phase and AlTi3_DO19 phase. The σ phase

forms at T ≤ 485 °C. The ratio of the temperature range where the primary BCC phase is stable over

the solidus temperature, namely, (Tsol − Tdec)/Tsol, is 0.52. Gao [26] suggested that a ratio ≥0.3 typically favors the formation of a single-phase solid solution in the as-cast state. Due to slow diffusivities at

low temperatures, it is unlikely to observe the BCC decomposition in a normal laboratory condition.

The non-equilibrium solidification simulation was accomplished, using the Scheil–Gulliver models

[55,56], which assume equilibrium mixing in the liquid and no diffusion in solids. The simulation

also predicts the formation of a single BCC solid-solution phase, as shown in Figure 8d.

Similarly, CALPHAD modeling predicts the likely formation of a single BCC phase for

NbTiVZr in the as-cast state (Figure 8b,e). The BCC phase forms at T ≤ 1650 °C; the solidus

temperature is 1465 °C. At T = 723 °C, the BCC phase decomposes to the BCC#1 phase that is rich in

Zr and Ti, and the BCC#2 phase that is rich in V and Nb. The calculated ratio of (Tsol − Tdec)/Tsol is 0.43.

Although the Scheil simulation predicts the formation of an additional BCC phase towards the end

of the non-equilibrium solidification, its mole fraction is less than 1%, and its presence may not be

detectable if any was to form in the alloy.

For AlCr0.5NbTiV (Figure 8c), the database predicts that the BCC phase forms at T ≤ 1739 °C; the

solidus temperature is 1734 °C. The C14 Laves phase forms in a narrow temperature range (765–819

°C). The σ phase forms at T ≤ 782 °C. As the temperature decreases, the BCC phase decomposes to

the BCC#1 phase that is poor in Nb and Ti (593–765 °C), and then to the BCC#2 phase that is very

rich in V but poor in Cr and Nb at T ≤ 593 °C. The AlTi3_DO19 phase forms at 593 °C. The calculated

ratio of (Tsol − Tdec)/Tsol is 0.46. The Scheil simulation also predicts the formation of a single BCC phase (Figure 8f). Using the true bulk composition reported by Stepanov et al. [11], the equilibration

calculation predicts that the C14 Laves phase forms at T = 739–883 °C; and the solidus is 1724 °C. In

fact, Stepanov et al. observed the formation of a single BCC phase when homogenized at 1200 °C

For AlNbTiV at equilibrium (Figure 8a), the database correctly predicts the formation of the BCC phase over an extremely wide temperature range. The primary BCC phase starts to form at

T = 1752 ◦C; the solidus temperature (Tsol) is 1717 ◦C. At the decomposition temperature (Tdec) of

679 ◦C, the primary BCC phase decomposes to a Ti-poor BCC phase and AlTi3_DO19 phase. The σ

phase forms at T ≤ 485 ◦C. The ratio of the temperature range where the primary BCC phase is

stable over the solidus temperature, namely, (Tsol − Tdec)/Tsol, is 0.52. Gao [26] suggested that a ratio ≥0.3 typically favors the formation of a single-phase solid solution in the as-cast state. Due to

slow diffusivities at low temperatures, it is unlikely to observe the BCC decomposition in a normal

laboratory condition. The non-equilibrium solidification simulation was accomplished, using the

Scheil–Gulliver models [55,56], which assume equilibrium mixing in the liquid and no diffusion in solids. The simulation also predicts the formation of a single BCC solid-solution phase, as shown in

Figure 8d.

Similarly, CALPHAD modeling predicts the likely formation of a single BCC phase for NbTiVZr in

the as-cast state (Figure 8b,e). The BCC phase forms at T ≤ 1650 ◦C; the solidus temperature is 1465 ◦C.

At T = 723 ◦C, the BCC phase decomposes to the BCC#1 phase that is rich in Zr and Ti, and the BCC#2

phase that is rich in V and Nb. The calculated ratio of (Tsol − Tdec)/Tsol is 0.43. Although the Scheil

simulation predicts the formation of an additional BCC phase towards the end of the non-equilibrium

solidification, its mole fraction is less than 1%, and its presence may not be detectable if any was to

form in the alloy.

For AlCr0.5NbTiV (Figure 8c), the database predicts that the BCC phase forms at T ≤ 1739 ◦C; the solidus temperature is 1734 ◦C. The C14 Laves phase forms in a narrow temperature range (765–819 ◦C).

The σ phase forms at T ≤ 782 ◦C. As the temperature decreases, the BCC phase decomposes to the

BCC#1 phase that is poor in Nb and Ti (593–765 ◦C), and then to the BCC#2 phase that is very rich

in V but poor in Cr and Nb at T ≤ 593 ◦C. The AlTi3_DO19 phase forms at 593 ◦C. The calculated

ratio of (Tsol − Tdec)/Tsol is 0.46. The Scheil simulation also predicts the formation of a single BCC

phase (Figure 8f). Using the true bulk composition reported by Stepanov et al. [11], the equilibration calculation predicts that the C14 Laves phase forms at T = 739–883 ◦C; and the solidus is 1724 ◦C.

In fact, Stepanov et al. observed the formation of a single BCC phase when homogenized at 1200 ◦C

and the C14 Laves when annealed at 800 ◦C, which is in agreement with the predictions shown in

Figure 8c.

For AlCrNbTiV (Figure 8g), the calculated liquids temperature from the database is 1730 ◦C; the solid temperature is 1726 ◦C. The primary BCC phase decomposes to the BCC#1 phase and

C14 Laves phase at T ≤ 1206 ◦C. AlTi3_DO19 forms at T ≤ 563 ◦C, and the σ phase forms at

712 ◦C. The calculated ratio of (Tsol − Tdec)/Tsol is 0.26. Using the true bulk composition reported in

Reference [11], the equilibration calculation predicts that the C14 laves phase starts to form at 1292 ◦C; the solid temperature is at 1722 ◦C. In fact, Stepanov et al. [11] observed the formation of the C14 Laves phase in the homogenized state (i.e., at 1200 ◦C) and for annealed states at 800 ◦C and 1000 ◦C. These

results generally agree with the predictions shown in Figure 8g.

For CrNbTiZr (Figure 8h), the database predicts that the primary phase is a Nb-rich BCC phase.

As the temperature deceases, the Nb content in the BCC phase decreases, while the Ti content increases.

At T ≤ 680 ◦C, the Ti-rich BCC#1 phase and Nb-rich BCC#2 phase form. The C15 Laves phase forms at

T ≤ 1384 ◦C. For CrNbTiVZr (Figure 8i), the primary crystallization phase is a BCC phase that has less Zr and Cr than Nb, V, and Ti, but the Zr and Cr contents continuously increase as the temperature

deceases. The C15 Laves phase forms at T ≤ 1297 ◦C. For both alloys, the predicted stable phases agree

well with experiments [13].

In summary, the present CALPHAD calculations using the TCNI8 database successfully

predict the formation of a single BCC phase in AlNbTiV, NbTiVZr, and AlCr0.5NbTiV, while most

empirical rules fail (Table 3). On the other hand, the CALPHAD-predicted crystal structures of intermetallics that form in AlCrNbTiV, CrNbTiZr, and CrNbTiVZr during solidification also agree

very well with experiments [11,13]. However, caution should be noted that the database does not

Similarly, significant negative excess entropy is also observed for NbAl x, NbTiAl x, NbTiVAl x, and CrNbTiVAl x alloys (except compositions close to the “terminals” in CrNbTiVAl x and NbTiVAl x, see Figure 9d). Also, the compositions with the maximum entropy of mixing deviate substantially

from their equimolar compositions (see Figure 9d). Note that the Δ S mix values are negative for nearly the entire compositional ranges for both Al-Ti and Al-Nb binaries (Figure 9a,d), suggesting

and dominate the total entropy of mixing.

5.1. Thermodynamic Mixing Properties of Al-Cr-Nb-Ti-V and Cr-Nb-Ti-V-Zr Systems

In order to lower the density below 7.0 g/cm3, additions of Al and/or Ti are required for

single-phase light-weight HEAs, but excess additions of these elements may cause the formation of

brittle intermetallic compounds. Even for the single-phase AlNbTiV, little tensile ductility is expected,





Entropy 2016, 18, 333

since its compressive fracture strain is very small at room temperature [9]. It is intuitively expected that the formation of strong covalent bonds in a solid solution, which should be reflected in the enthalpy,

may cause the embrittlement seen in the alloy. As a consequence, one natural question arises: How do

the thermodynamic properties evolve with their additions? Furthermore, as shown in Table 3, those developed-empirical rules basically fail for Al-containing single-phase HEAs, but why?

This subsection attempts to answer these questions by first examining the underlying

thermodynamic properties of the BCC phase for selected alloy systems using the CALPHAD method.

To eliminate the effect from the pure elements, only the thermodynamic-mixing properties are

presented by setting the reference state to the BCC phase at the temperature of interest. The mixing

properties of the Al-Cr-Nb-Ti-V system at 1000 ◦C are shown in Figure 9a–f for varying compositions in binaries and pseudo-binaries with respect to Ti and Al, respectively.

For AlTix, AlVTix, AlNbVTix, and AlCrNbVTix alloys (Figure 9a), the total entropies of mixing (∆SBCC) fall well below the respective ideal configurational entropies. Thus, these systems exhibit

mix

significant negative excess entropy (exSBCC) for the BCC phase. The excess entropy (exS φ ) of a

mix

mix

solution phase ( φ) is defined by the difference between the total entropy of mixing (∆S φ ) and the mix

ideal configurational entropy, as determined in Equation (9):

ex S φ = ∆S φ + R∑ c

mix

mix

(9)

i

Similarly, significant negative excess entropy is also observed for NbAlx, NbTiAlx, NbTiVAlx, and

CrNbTiVAlx alloys (except compositions close to the “terminals” in CrNbTiVAlx and NbTiVAlx, see

Figure 9d). Also, the compositions with the maximum entropy of mixing deviate substantially from their equimolar compositions (see Figure 9d). Note that the ∆SBCC values are negative for nearly the mix

entire compositional ranges for both Al-Ti and Al-Nb binaries (Figure 9a,d), suggesting that another entropy source, such as the vibrational entropy of mixing, may be extremely negative and dominate

the total entropy of mixing.

The enthalpies of mixing (∆HBCC) (see Figure 9b,e) at the equimolar compositions are very mix

large negative values, and, thus, they contribute significantly to the Gibbs free energies, as shown

in Figure 9c,f (Since ∆Gmix = ∆Hmix − T∆Smix). It is noteworthy that for those M-Ti binary and pseudo-binaries, the lowest ∆HBCC (−32 kJ/mol) occurs at 50 at.% Ti in the Al-Ti binary system,

mix

but the value for each system becomes less negative quickly with increasing the number of components

(Figure 9b). In contrast, for those M-Al binary and pseudo-binaries (see Figure 9e), the lowest ∆HBCC

mix

for each system occurs in the vicinity of 50 at.% Al, due to the strong ordering tendency to form the

CsCl-type B2 phase.

To differentiate the effects of Al and Ti additions, the thermodynamic-mixing properties of the

Cr-Nb-Ti-V-Zr system are shown in Figure 9g–i. It is clear that the absence of Al boosts ∆SBCC

mix

substantially (if one compares Figure 9g to Figure 9a,d). ∆SBCC for the Cr-Ti binary behaves almost like mix

the ideal entropy of mixing, while the CrNbVZrTix pseudo-binary exhibits the small negative excess

entropy of mixing, since its total entropy of mixing is smaller than the ideal configurational entropy.

Note that the CrVTix and CrNbVTix alloys actually exhibit the positive excess entropy, since their

total entropies of mixing are greater than their ideal configurational entropies. ∆HBCC (Figure 9h) are mix

positive except Ti-poor compositions for the CrVTix alloys, implying repulsive interatomic interactions

among these refractory metal elements. In this case, the entropy outweighs the enthalpy in the

contribution to the Gibbs free energy (Figure 9i).

5.2. Common Issues of Empirical Rules

The empirical rules proposed for the solid-solution HEAs are based on Hume-Rothery rules,

thermodynamics, or their combination, and they are established, based on the available experimental

data reported in the literature, which includes three main categories of the single-phase solid solution, solid solution + intermetallics, and metallic glasses. As the new experimental data emerge, it is not

Entropy 2016, 18, 333

16 of 21

surprising to see that those rules may fail for certain compositions. Because most critical values

that are proposed in those empirical rules are not scientifically derived. Rather, they are statistically determined based on the available experimental data. For example, the threshold value of the φ

parameter was originally proposed to be 20, but it is identified to be 7 for light-weight HEAs in

the present study. Similarly, the critical δ r is identified to be ≤4.7%, and ∆Hmix ≥ −16.25kJ · mol−1.

A similar phenomenon was also observed for the valence electron concentration (VEC). As reported,

FCC phases are found to be stable at higher VEC (>8) and instead BCC phases are stable at lower VEC

(<6.87) [17]. However, in light-weight HEAs, although VECs for all the listed light-weight HEAs are smaller than 6, most light-weight HEAs do not present the stable single-phase BCC structure. In other

words, these threshold values (e.g., φ, δ r, VEC, etc. ) are sensitive to alloy systems and compositions, and, therefore, can be a range rather than a fixed value.

Furthermore, the HEA community has used the empirical enthalpy data for liquids, based

on the Miedema model [37] to describe the interatomic interactions in the solid-solution HEAs.

This out-of-convenience approach may work in certain cases, but in general, it should be avoided if

possible. In fact, a prior study by Gao et al. [27] showed that: “both the sign and absolute value of

∆

liq

HBCC are not necessarily in accord with ∆H

: For example, nine alloys exhibit opposite sign while

mix

mix

seven alloys show the significant contrast in their absolute values.” Furthermore, the accuracy of the

liquid enthalpy data from the Miedema model is questionable for certain alloy systems.

In order to address the enthalpy contribution for a multi-component solid solution phase,

King et al. [20] first proposed to approximate it as the composition weighted sum of the enthalpy of formation of the constituent binary concentrated solid solution based on the Miedema model.

However, this approach does not consider the crystal structure of the solid solution phase, and its

robustness requires verification with experimental measurements, CALPHAD modeling, and/or

DFT calculations.

In general, the enthalpy of mixing of a solid solution is sensitive to the crystal structure, and the

value may vary among FCC, BCC, and HCP structures. As proposed in a recent study [26], the enthalpy of formation (∆Hf ) of solid-solution HEAs with the FCC, BCC, and HCP structures should be used

to establish the ∆Hf − δ r relation. For the enthalpy of the formation of single-phase HEAs, readers are referred to recent first-principles density functional calculations [26,35–57], since the experimental enthalpy data for HEAs are not available in the literature.

Φ and Φf are designed intentionally to illustrate the thermodynamic competition between the

solid-solution phase and intermetallic phases. While the solid-solution phase contains all the principal

elements for both models, the intermetallics is represented by the most stable binary compound.

Furthermore, both models ignore the entropy of intermetallic compounds, and Φ f also ignore the

mixing of enthalpy for solid solutions, which have been pointed out by Senkov and Miracle [33].

Consequently, both models have thermodynamic flaws, since the phase stability of a multi-component

alloy is not determined by the simple comparison of the Gibbs free energy in a solid solution without

specifying the crystal structure with that of a hypothetical or binary compound phase; rather, it is

determined by the equilibrium condition that the chemical potential of each component should be

equal in all phases. In fact, the simple comparison of the Gibbs free energy among phases is only valid

for the unary system when to determine phase equilibria.

Also, ignoring the enthalpy contribution of the solid-solution phase, as exercised by

Troparevsky et al. [18], can severely underestimate the Gibbs free energy of certain solid-solution phases if the interatomic interactions among constituent elements are very strong, as evidenced in

AlCrNbVTix (see Figure 9b) and CrNbTiVAlx (see Figure 9e). The present CALPHAD modeling predicts

∆HBCC to be −32, −26, −24, −22, −18, and −12 kJ/mol for AlTi, AlNb, AlNbTi, AlTiV, AlNbTiV, and

mix

AlCrNbTiV, respectively, at 1000 ◦C. On the other hand, the enthalpies of formation for solid-solution

phases and intermetallics estimated from the Miedema model may suffer from the inaccuracy issue.

Furthermore, using the most stable binary compound to represent the competing intermetallic phase in

a multi-component system may overestimate its thermodynamic stability. The combined consequence





Entropy 2016, 18, 333

17 of 21

is that these models will underestimate the likely compositions that may form single-phase solid

solutions. For example, forming a single BCC-phase in AlNbTiV was predicted by CALPHAD

modeling (Figure 8a,d), and was experimentally verified [9], but Φ and Φ f parameters as well as the ∆Hf − δ r relation fail to predict the formation of a single solid-solution phase. Nonetheless, the calculated Φ and Φ f values generally show remarkable similarity for alloys listed in Table 2 except certain compositions that contain Al and Mg and/or Li, and those that contain Hf. The similarity

between Φ and Φ f shown in Table 2 can be understood, through the ratio

may be attributed to the intrinsic connection between the Mediema model and DFT calculations.

Lastly, for the Al-containing HEAs, the actual entropy of mixing can be substantially depressed

due to strong interatomic interactions between Al and TMs. For example, the calculated ∆Smix are

−4, −2, +2, +3, +6, and +10 J/(mol·K) for AlTi, AlNb, AlNbTi, AlTiV, AlNbTiV, and AlCrNbTiV,

respectively; they are well below the corresponding ideal configurational entropy (Figure 9a,d),

especially for the binary and ternary alloys. The much lowered entropy for the Al-containing HEAs

may contribute to the additional uncertainty when predicting the solid-solution formation, using those

empirical rules.

5.3. Perspectives of Future Design of Light-Weight HEAs

As demonstrated in the present and other studies, the CALPHAD method is the ideal approach

to predict the phase stability in multi-component systems, such as HEAs. The main limitation of

CALPHAD is the reliability of the thermodynamic database. A robust self-consistent database for

HEAs requires the optimization of all constituent binaries and ternaries over the entire composition and

temperature ranges. When such a database is not available, reliance on empirical rules, phase-diagram

inspections, and density functional theory (DFT) modeling may be necessary. In fact, Gao et al. [26]

has demonstrated an effective approach that combines the phase-diagram inspection, CALPHAD

modeling, first-principles DFT calculations, and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, and

suggested hundreds of new single-phase equimolar HEA compositions. For example, Gao suggested

quaternary and higher-order equimolar compositions in the Dy-Er-Gd-Ho-Lu-Sc-Sm-Tb-Tm-Y system,

Ba-Ca-Eu-Sr-Yb system, Mo-Nb-Ta-Ti-V-W system, and Mo-Nb-Re-Ta-Ti-V-W system [26].

Strong attractive interactions between Al and TMs, and between Ti and late TMs (such as Mn, Fe,

Co, and Ni) cause the formation of very stable intermetallic compounds, and, thus, the formation of

single-phase HEAs that contain Al and/or Ti in high contents is difficult. Therefore, the total number

of single-phase light-weight HEAs is very limited, and their densities are generally above 5.5 g/cm3

(see Table 2). On the other hand, for practical applications, the alloy compositions do not need to be equimolar or near-equimolar ratios, and most importantly, multi-phase microstructures are usually

desirable to balance various materials properties, especially the excellent combination of strength and

ductility. Therefore, from the application point of view, a rational approach for the future design of

light-weight HEAs with a density less than 5.0 g/cm3 can be described below:

(1)

Identify the main alloying elements in addition to the dominant principal element (such as Ti, Al,

or Mg), based on the target-properties requirement.

(2)

Use the high-entropy concept to adjust the bulk composition so as to maximize the solubility of

key strengthening (or ductilizing, anti-oxidation, etc.) alloying elements.

(3)

Predict phase stability using the CALPHAD method, DFT modeling, and/or empirical criteria,

and design processing and heat-treatment routes to optimize the microstructure.

(4)

Fabricate the down-selected alloys and characterize their microstructures and mechanical

(and other) properties.

(5)

Refine alloy design by repeating the above procedures.

6. Conclusions

The present study investigated the phase formation in AlxCrFeMnTiy, assessed various empirical

rules pertaining to light-weight HEAs, and carried out CALPHAD modeling on Al-Cr-Nb-Ti-V and

Cr-Nb-Ti-V-Zr systems. The following conclusions were reached:

(1)

Empirical rules are not conclusive in predicting solid-solution formation, and they are susceptible

to the alloy systems and compositions that are assessed. As new experimental data emerge, these

rules are subject to reevaluation. Consequently, the proposed threshold values pertaining to those

empirical rules are sensitive to alloy systems and compositions, and can fluctuate within a range

of values. For light-weight HEAs, the following criteria have been identified: φ c ≥ 7, δ r ≤ 4.7%, and ∆Hmix ≥ −16.25kJ · mol−1.

(2)

The combination of Φ or Φ f with δ r appears to be more effective criteria than with ∆Hmix or Ω

to differentiate SS from SS + IM.

(3)

For certain HEAs with strong interatomic interactions among constituent elements, such as

Al-containing HEAs, empirical rules may severely underestimate the free energies of the

solid-solution phases by ignoring the enthalpy contribution of the solid-solution phase.

(4)

The present CALPHAD modeling using the TCNI8 database successfully predicts the single BCC

phase in AlNbTiV, Al0.5NbTiV, and NbTiVZr, while most empirical rules fail to do so.

(5)

The calculated entropies of mixing (∆SBCC) for the BCC phase at 1000 ◦C are −4, −2, +2, +3,

mix

+6, and +10 J/(mol·K) for AlTi, AlNb, AlNbTi, AlTiV, AlNbTiV, and AlCrNbTiV, respectively;

they are well below the corresponding ideal configurational entropy, especially for the binary

and ternary alloys. Therefore, these systems exhibit noticeable negative excess entropy with the

BCC structure.

(6)

The present CALPHAD modeling predicts that the enthalpies of mixing (∆HBCC) for the BCC

mix

phase at 1000 ◦C are −32, −26, −24, −22, −18, and −12 kJ/mol for AlTi, AlNb, AlNbTi, AlTiV,

AlNbTiV, and AlCrNbTiV, respectively.

(7)

Forming Al-containing equimolar light-weight HEAs with a density less than 5.5 g/cm3 is very

challenging due to very attractive interatomic interactions between Al and TMs. As such, future

efforts could be shifted towards Al-rich (or Ti-rich, or Mg-rich) alloys that contain large amounts

of desirable solute elements, which may dissolve in solution and/or promote the formation of

beneficial precipitates, taking advantage of the high-entropy concept.
